# WEX Avon1 Assessment Refactoring Guide

Welcome to your refactoring challenge for the WEX Avon1 financial management application. This guide will provide you with hints and directions to identify and correct inefficiencies and errors in the application's current design and implementation. Your goal is to enhance the application's code quality, functionality, and user experience.

## Getting Started

### Cloning the Repository

Before you begin refactoring, ensure you have access to the application's code by cloning the repository. Use the following steps if you're unfamiliar with the process:

1. **Generate an SSH Key**: If you haven't already, generate an SSH key on your machine. [GitHub's documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) provides a comprehensive guide.
2. **Add SSH Key to GitHub**: Ensure your SSH key is added to your GitHub account. Follow this [guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account) if you need help.
3. **Clone the Repository**: With your SSH key set up, clone the repository using the SSH URL provided in the project's GitHub page.

### Setting Up Your Environment

After cloning the repository, prepare your development environment:

- Ensure you have _**.NET 6**_ installed.
- Ensure that you have _**Entity Framework 6**_ installed.
- Navigate to the _**FinanceManagement.Api**_ project directory.
- _**Create the Entity Framework Migrations**_ in your local project. Don't run it.
- Ensure that you have installed the [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and it is running.
- Use _**docker-compose**_ as launch option.

## Refactoring Hints

### General Refactoring Hints and Best Practices

As you embark on refactoring the WEX Avon1 financial management application, here are some general hints and best practices that can guide your efforts across all areas of the project. These principles aim to improve code quality, maintainability, and scalability.

#### Commit Messages Should Tell a Story

- **Narrative Commit Messages**: Your commit history is a logbook of the project's evolution. Craft your commit messages to clearly describe what changes were made and why. This practice aids in code reviews, debugging, and understanding the project's history.

#### Scale in Mind

- **Design for Scalability**: Write your code with future growth in mind. This means considering how your code will perform under increased loads and what patterns or architectures will allow it to scale smoothly. Avoid hardcoding values or making assumptions that could limit scalability.

#### Clarity and Readability

- **Clear and Readable Code**: Strive for simplicity and clarity in your code. Use meaningful variable and method names, break down complex functions into smaller, manageable pieces, and add comments where necessary to explain the "why" behind certain decisions. Remember, code is read more often than it's written, so readability is key.

#### Design Patterns and Flexibility

- **Leverage Design Patterns**: Feel encouraged to implement design patterns where appropriate. Design patterns provide proven solutions to common problems and can make your code more adaptable and easier to maintain. Whether it's structural patterns like MVC for organizing your project, or behavioral patterns to define how objects interact, the right pattern can significantly enhance your application's architecture.

- **Openness to New Implementations**: Don't hesitate to introduce new technologies, libraries, or frameworks that could improve the project's functionality, performance, or user experience. However, ensure that each addition is justified and doesn't introduce unnecessary complexity.

#### Encapsulation and Data Exposure

- **Protect Sensitive Data**: Be mindful of what data your API exposes. Use DTOs or View Models to control the data that is sent to and received from the client, ensuring that sensitive information is kept secure and that the API's contract is clear and intentional.

#### Performance Optimization

- **Efficient Data Operations**: Pay special attention to how your application interacts with the database. Optimize queries to avoid fetching unnecessary data, use indexing to speed up searches, and consider caching strategies to reduce load times for frequently accessed data.

By keeping these general hints and best practices in mind, you'll be well on your way to refactoring the WEX Avon1 financial management application into a more robust, scalable, and maintainable project. Remember, refactoring is not just about fixing what's broken but also about improving and preparing the code for future challenges.

### OAuth Configuration

- **Hint**: The application's authentication might be incomplete. Look into the Program.cs file for missing configurations related to Duende.IdentityServer.

### Controllers

- **Hint 1**: Exception handling in controllers can often be improved. Consider alternative ways to handle errors and provide feedback to the client.
- **Hint 2**: Dependency injection is a powerful tool for decoupling code. Investigate how the repository pattern is used within controllers.
- **Hint 3**: Analyze the efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation methods, particularly how income data is accessed and updated.
- **Hint 4**: A few endpoints may not have the most efficient way to fetch data from the database, potentially leading to performance issues. When retrieving a specific income entry by its ID, it's crucial to ensure that the query is as direct and streamlined as possible to minimize resource utilization and enhance response times.

### Data Access Layer

- **Hint 1**: Review how the application manages database connections and queries. There may be opportunities to enhance error handling and connection management.
- **Hint 2**: Hardcoded values and repeated code can often be refactored for better maintainability and security.
- **Hint 3**: When returning data from your API, directly exposing entity models to the caller can pose significant risks, such as unintended data exposure. It's crucial to implement a strategy that encapsulates the data, ensuring that only the necessary information is shared with the client. This approach not only enhances data security but also gives you more control over the data presented to the end-user.

### Object Models

- **Hint**: The application's data models might benefit from reevaluation. Consider relationships between models and how they're used throughout the application.

### Testing

- **Hint**: With refactoring, testing becomes crucial to ensure existing functionality remains unaffected. Consider adding unit tests for critical parts of the application.

## Final Steps

After refactoring, thoroughly test the application to ensure all functionalities work as expected. Pay special attention to authentication flows and data processing logic to ensure no new issues have been introduced during the refactoring process.
